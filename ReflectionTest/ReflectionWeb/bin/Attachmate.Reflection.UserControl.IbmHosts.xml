            This component maybe cached by DEVENV process in temp directory if this control was viewed in IDE design time view. In this case the VS ide should be closed
            and restarted to load the current IbmTerminalControl after it has been installed in the GAC. This will not occur in end user environment, but occurs on dev 
            machine while this component is being modified and rebuilt. It is initially confusing to not see the results of a change. Later on used the debug statement with some 
            changes to confirm the right version of the file was in use.
